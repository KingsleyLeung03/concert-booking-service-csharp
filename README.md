# Concert Booking Service  
By Kingsley Leung (Zihong Liang)  

A concert booking service, using C# and ASP.NET.  

## Description  
This is a booking service for a venue. The venue has 15 seats with three rows and five columns. The venue's seats are classified into two price bands ($120 and $80).  
A concert can happen on different dates, and each concert has at least one performer. A performer can be in many concerts.  
The service lets clients get information about concerts and performers, ask about seats and reservations, and log in.  
When making a reservation, clients can ask about available seats. They should know which seats are free and their prices. Clients can choose any number of seats to book. Double-bookings are not allowed. Only one client can book a seat for a concert on a specific date. Clients must book all their selected seats or none at all.  
Clients can see concert and performer information and ask about available seats, whether they are logged in or not. When logged in, clients can make reservations and see their own reservations. Clients cannot see other guestsâ€™ reservation information.
